How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  I write programs that are maintaiable and readable by following the PEP8 guide. I try to create modular and properly abstracted code that can be resued in a variety of cirumstances with very little modification. This is done by wrapping the functions of the database into python functions that are used by our dashboard. These same functions could be repurposed for any mongodb database with very little effort. 
  
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist I try and approach problems in a logical manner, looking for the solution to the problem that I can create with modular and reuasable code. I think about creating a framework or a foundation for the project that contains the basic functionality that I can then access and use in the application. My approach to this problem was different because it required 2 modules, a front and backend. The front used the utilities developed in the backend and required code for displaying the information to the end user. In the future I will consider how backend utilities might be written for easier use or importing into other applications. In interacting with databases, we can create modular and basic code that can be repurposed to fit into our requirements.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

A computer scientist can create software that arranges large amounts of data and automates the retrieval and interaction with the data to service all the users of the Grazioso Salvare software. This type of work helps a company by reducing the amount of work needed to create these data tables, organizing data and manually filtering through the data. This software automates all that and with minimal training a single person can be far more productive and much quicker thanks to thie software.
